# PyPhemo
A simple discord bot made to execute Python code in discord

# How does it work?
It works by doing '/py' and then it tries to find a value called code that stores your print. And then checks whether or not the code is valid and if it is then its ready to be send. When its ready it will create a embed for the peice of string you want it to send and then it triple backticks to look like its code thats being printed.
